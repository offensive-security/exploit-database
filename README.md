The Exploit-Database Git Repository
===================================

This is the official repository of [The Exploit Database](http://www.exploit-db.com/), a project sponsored by [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/).

The Exploit Database is an archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software, developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Its aim is to serve as the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing lists, and other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need actionable data right away.

This repository is updated daily with the most recently added submissions. Any additional resources can be found in our [binary sploits repository](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploit-database-bin-sploits).

Included with this repository is the **searchsploit** utility, which will allow you to search through the exploits using one or more terms.

```
root@kali:~# searchsploit -h
  Usage: searchsploit [OPTIONS] term1 [term2] ... [termN]
Example: searchsploit oracle windows local

=========
 OPTIONS
=========
 -c         - Perform case-sensitive searches; by default,
              searches will try to be greedy
 -v         - By setting verbose output, description lines
              are allowed to overflow their columns
 -h, --help - Show help screen

NOTES:
 - Use any number of search terms you would like (minimum: 1)
 - Search terms are not case sensitive, and order is irrelevant
Usage: searchsploit [options] term1 [term2] ... [termN]
Example:
  searchsploit afd windows local
  searchsploit -f oracle windows remote

=========
 Options
=========
   -c, --case     Perform case-sensitive searches (Default is insensitive).
   -f, --file     Searches include file's path (Default is just the exploit title).
   -h, --help     Show this help screen.
   -u, --update   Update Database from git.
   -v, --verbose  Verbose output. Title lines are allowed to overflow their columns.
   -w, --www      Show URLs to Exploit-DB.com rather than local path.
       --colour   Disables colour highlighting on match.
       --id       Display EDB-ID value rather than local path.

=======
 Notes
=======
 * Use any number of search terms you would like (at least 1 value), in any order.
 * Search terms are not case sensitive, and order is irrelevant.
   * Use '-c' if you wish to reduce results by case-sensitive searching.
* Use '-f' to include the file's path to increase the search results.
   * Could possibly increase false positives (especially when searching numbers).
 * When updating from git or displaying help, searches will be ignored.
